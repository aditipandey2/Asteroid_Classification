Asteroid Classification Project   
Overview

This project focuses on classifying asteroids as hazardous (True) or non-hazardous (False) based on various features. The dataset is preprocessed using pandas and visualized with seaborn and matplotlib. Key steps include one-hot encoding, dropping irrelevant columns, handling correlation, and utilizing the XGBoost classifier for model building.
